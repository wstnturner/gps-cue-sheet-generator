#summary How to use Ant for compiling and running the program

= Compiling the project =

Assuming you have a directory called "pathfinder" which you got by checking out the SVN repo:

{{{
$ cd pathfinder
$ ant compile
}}}

This will compile the source files from the src directory (PathFinder.java, for example) into corresponding class files in the build directory.

= Creating a jar file =

{{{
$ ant jar
}}}

will create a jar file from the class files in build (compiling first if necessary), and put the jar file in build/jar/.

= Running =

{{{
$ ant run
}}}

This will take the jar file in build/jar/ (compiling and creating the jar file first if necessary) and execute the main method of the class specified in the build.xml main-class property (currently set to cis522/PathFinder.class).

= Cleaning =

{{{
$ ant clean
}}}

will remove the build directory and all files in it (compiled class files and jar files). It will also remove the dist directory.

= Making a distribution jar with timestamp =

{{{
$ ant dist
}}}

will create a timestamp-labeled jar file in dist/lib.
