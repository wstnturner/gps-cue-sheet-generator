#summary Stuff for the final week

Finish technical docs

* architecture doc - Kurt

* generate doxygen docs - Kurt/Weston

** make sure all code is commented for good docs; file headers for each file, method headers for public methods - Weston?

User docs

* readme.txt - Hang

* user manual - Hang

* in-app help - Jungyul

Testing

* gather collection of GPX files for testing

** good files:

*** short

*** long

*** really long!

** bad files:

*** empty

*** not XML data; just a text file

*** XML file but with no GPX tags

*** GPX file with corruption (unclosed tags)

*** GPX file with bad data (alphanumeric rather than numeric lat/long data)

* list of UI elements to test ("click the File Open dialog box, select a file...")

** this should be a comprehensive set of directions about how to test every feature of the program

* list of operating systems to test, with notes about differences (no file open dialog on Mac, for instance)
